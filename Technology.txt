getForm.io
==========
- This website allows users to create a (just 1) free endpoint to allow users to create input forms to allow users to send emails from a website.
- You must use a form tag with specific props passed to it (action and method)

============
React-Scroll
============
- This library was used to implement scrolling
- Must also download the @types version for it
- Used the Link component to do the scroll. Can use id/className in order to target where to scroll

====
Grid
====
- Another powerful component like flexbox
- There are different times when to use grid and flexbox. General rule of thumb is grid is used for multiple dimensional, flexbox for 1 dimensional, but there are A LOT of grey areas around these uses
